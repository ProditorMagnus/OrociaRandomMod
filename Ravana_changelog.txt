4.x todo
consider hp multiplier and delayed waves
dependencies=Ageless_Era,XP_Modification,Plan_Your_Advancements_Mod,Switch_Leader,Color_Modification,Ally_Village_Modification

! turn 40 normal had units start with less than max hp
less players should come with less upgrade spots and less villages too
! overlay for units showing upgrades
Pagawan is my big fan, I should play with him
! test for broken saves/replay with ultra
! specials for swamp map, maybe extra poison power, lower resists (insect swarm event)
<22:54 FakeNews> i would love to see the map flood over time
<23:17 FakeNews> i wish there was an armor to take
! armor that gives poison immunity, or item that gives poison to all attacks
! tell player that swamp map has higher poison
Should Castle description affects swamp castle - change to swamp?
Create release only if ageless version changes
Detect weaker factions
Make zonk less powerful, temporary
<03:20 ghype> maybe use follwing setup when zonk included ( 1x zonk / 2x res / 2x hp / 2x dmg / 2x str / 2 def )
<03:20 ghype> so zonk is less likely ot drop and u dont deal wiht mv anymore
Look if some bonuses needed for waves with divergence
Consider if ronsmap items should be sidelocked - ron said that can be - to be implemented later
Look xp setting too, but not very importantly
Make stuff configurable during game, allow setting start value, and per wave increase, with 120 and 0.02 as initially, see what can be moved to Lua
Persistent score database
setting to generate unit lists from currently used era
do something when shrine is destroyed

Plans that would be nice:
allow player compose waves with menu
upgrades visual marker
infinite waves with unit type names changed like http://files.wesnoth.org/addons/1.12/Better_Names.tar.bz2
